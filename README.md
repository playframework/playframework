## Play Framework - The High Velocity Web Framework 

The Play Framework combines productivity and performance making it easy to build scalable web applications with Java and Scala.  Play is developer friendly with a "just hit refresh" workflow and built-in testing support.  With Play, applications scale predictably due to a stateless and non-blocking architecture.  By being RESTful by default, including assets compilers, JSON & WebSocket support, Play is a perfect fit for modern web & mobile applications.
