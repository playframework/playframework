# Make sure scripted tests run with the same git commit that was used for the publish-local job.
# For each CI job the CI server always clones the latest up-to-date base branch and, if the current job is for a pull request,
# then "fetches" the current pull request on top of it (just look at the logs of a PR job, you will see "git fetch origin +refs/pull/<#PR>/merge").
# Now if another pull request gets merged in the time window during the publish-local and a scripted job, the base branches moves forward
# and the CI server will now clone that newer base branch before "fetching" the current PR on it. Of course now the commit hash has changed and
# the distance from the latest tag has increased, so the Play version set by dynver will be different than the one used for publish-local, resulting
# in "unresolved dependencies" errors.
