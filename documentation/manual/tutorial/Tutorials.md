# Play Tutorials

Play's documentation shows the available features and how to use them, but the documentation will not show how to create an application from start to finish.  This is where tutorials and examples come in.

Tutorials and examples are useful for showing a single application at work, especially when it comes to integrating with other systems such as databases or Javascript frameworks.

The Play team uses [Lightbend Tech Hub](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play) to publish tutorials that cover a huge number of cases. There you can find projects in Java, Scala and for multiple versions of Play. You can pick one that demonstrates functionality of interest to you. The examples you can download cover the following topics:

## Java
