## Continuous Integration

Our continuous integration runs on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/playframework/playframework). We not only run CI on major release and main branches, but we also perform github pull request validation using Travis functionality.

## Profiling

We are using [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/) for profiling our Java and Scala code. YourKit really helps us keep Play's resource usage to the minimum that you'd expect.
