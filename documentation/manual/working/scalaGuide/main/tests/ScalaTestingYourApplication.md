# Testing your application

Writing tests for your application can be an involved process. Play offers integration with both [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org) and [specs2](https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) and provides helpers and application stubs to make testing your application as easy as possible. For the details of using your preferred test framework with Play, see the pages on [[ScalaTest|ScalaTestingWithScalaTest]] or [[specs2|ScalaTestingWithSpecs2]].
