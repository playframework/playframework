# Main concepts for Scala

This section introduces you to the most common aspects of writing a Play application in Scala. You'll learn about handling HTTP requests, sending HTTP responses, working with different types of data, using databases and much more.

> **Note**: The Play APIs for Scala and Java are separated into different packages. All the Scala APIs are under the `play.api` package; all the Java APIs are under `play`. For example, the Scala MVC API is under `play.api.mvc` and the Java MVC API is under `play.mvc`.
