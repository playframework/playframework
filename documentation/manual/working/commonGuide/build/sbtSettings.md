# About sbt Settings

## About sbt settings

The `build.sbt` file defines settings for your project. You can also define your own custom settings for your project, as described in the [sbt documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html).  In particular, it helps to be familiar with the [settings](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Settings-Core.html) in sbt.

To set a basic setting, use the `:=` operator:

```scala
confDirectory := "myConfFolder"     
```

## Default settings for Java applications

Play defines a default set of settings suitable for Java-based applications. To enable them add the `PlayJava` plugin via your project's enablePlugins method. These settings mostly define the default imports for generated templates e.g. importing `java.lang.*` so types like `Long` are the Java ones by default instead of the Scala ones. `play.Project.playJavaSettings` also imports `java.util.*` so that the default collection library will be the Java one.

## Default settings for Scala applications

Play defines a default set of settings suitable for Scala-based applications. To enable them add the `PlayScala` plugin via your project's enablePlugins method. These default settings define the default imports for generated templates (such as internationalized messages, and core APIs).
