# Main concepts for Java

This section introduces you to the most common aspects of writing a Play application in Java. You'll learn about handling HTTP requests, sending HTTP responses, working with different types of data, using databases and much more.

> **Note:** The Play APIs for Java and Scala are separated into different packages. All the Java APIs are under the `play` package; all the Scala APIs are under `play.api`. For example, the Java MVC API is under `play.mvc` and the Scala MVC API is under `play.api.mvc`.
