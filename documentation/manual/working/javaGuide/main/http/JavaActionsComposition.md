# Action composition

This chapter introduces several ways to define generic action functionality.

## Reminder about actions

Previously, we said that an action is a Java method that returns a `play.mvc.Result` value. Actually, Play manages internally actions as functions. An action provided by the Java API is an instance of [`play.mvc.Action`](api/java/play/mvc/Action.html). Play builds a root action for you that just calls the proper action method. This allows for more complicated action composition.

## Composing actions

Here is the definition of the `VerboseAction`:

@[verbose-action](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

You can compose the code provided by the action method with another `play.mvc.Action`, using the [`@With`](api/java/play/mvc/With.html) annotation:

@[verbose-index](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

At one point you need to delegate to the wrapped action using `delegate.call(...)`.

You also mix several actions by using custom action annotations:

@[authenticated-cached-index](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

> **Note:**  Every request **must** be served by a distinct instance of your `play.mvc.Action`. If a singleton pattern is used, requests will be routed incorrectly during multiple request scenarios. For example, if you are using Spring as a DI container for Play, you need to make sure that your action beans are prototype scoped.

> **Note:**  [`play.mvc.Security.Authenticated`](api/java/play/mvc/Security.Authenticated.html) and [`play.cache.Cached`](api/java/play/cache/Cached.html) annotations and the corresponding predefined Actions are shipped with Play. See the relevant API documentation for more information.

## Defining custom action annotations

You can also mark action composition with your own annotation, which must itself be annotated using `@With`:

@[verbose-annotation](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

Your `Action` definition retrieves the annotation as configuration:

@[verbose-annotation-action](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

You can then use your new annotation with an action method:

@[verbose-annotation-index](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

## Annotating controllers

You can also put any action composition annotation directly on the `Controller` class. In this case it will be applied to all action methods defined by this controller.

@[annotated-controller](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

> **Note:** If you want the action composition annotation(s) put on a `Controller` class to be executed before the one(s) put on action methods set `play.http.actionComposition.controllerAnnotationsFirst = true` in `application.conf`. However, be aware that if you use a third party module in your project it may rely on a certain execution order of its annotations.

## Passing objects from action to controller

You can pass an object from an action to a controller by utilizing request attributes.

@[pass-arg-action](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

Then in an action you can get the request attribute like this:

@[pass-arg-action-index](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

## Debugging the action composition order

To see in which order the actions of the action composition chain will be executed, please add the following to `logback.xml`:

```
<logger name="play.mvc.Action" level="DEBUG" />
```

You will now see the whole action composition chain with the according annotations (and their associated method/controller) in the logs:

```
[debug] play.mvc.Action - ### Start of action order
[debug] play.mvc.Action - 1. ...
[debug] play.mvc.Action - 2. ...
[debug] play.mvc.Action - ### End of action order
```

## Using Dependency Injection

You can use [[runtime Dependency Injection|JavaDependencyInjection]] or [[compile-time Dependency Injection|JavaCompileTimeDependencyInjection]]together with action composition. 

### Runtime Dependency Injection

For example, if you want to define your own result cache solution, first define the annotation:

@[action-composition-dependency-injection-annotation](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

And then you can define your action with the dependencies injected:

@[action-composition-dependency-injection](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

> **Note:** As stated above, every request **must** be served by a distinct instance of your `play.mvc.Action` and you **must not** annotate your action as a `@Singleton`.

### Compile-time Dependency Injection

When using [[compile-time Dependency Injection|JavaCompileTimeDependencyInjection]], you need to manually add your `Action` supplier to [`JavaHandlerComponents`](api/scala/play/core/j/JavaHandlerComponents.html). You do that by overriding method `javaHandlerComponents` in [`BuiltInComponents`](api/java/play/BuiltInComponents.html):

@[action-composition-compile-time-di](code/javaguide/http/JavaActionsComposition.java)

> **Note:** As stated above, every request **must** be served by a distinct instance of your `play.mvc.Action` and that is why you add a `java.util.function.Supplier<Action>` instead of the instance itself. Of course, you can have a `Supplier` returning the same instance every time, but this is not encouraged.
