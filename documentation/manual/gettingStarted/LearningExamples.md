# Learning from Play Examples

[Lightbend Tech Hub](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play) offers downloadable Play examples for Java and Scala. Play has many features, so rather than pack them all into one project, we've organized many examples that each showcase a Play feature or demonstrate a common use case. The zip files include everything you need to build and run the examples, including a distribution of the sbt and Gradle. Refer to the `README.md` file in the top level project directory to learn more about the example.

> **Note**: the example projects are not configured for out of the box security.

If you are new to Play, we recommend following the Hello World tutorial for Java or Scala first:

1. [Play Java Hello World](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play&project=play-java-hello-world-tutorial)
2. [Play Scala Hello World](https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play&project=play-scala-starter-example)

> **Note**: When you run the tutorial application, it displays web pages with the same content and instructions contained in this documentation. The tutorial includes a deliberate mistake and having the [[the documentation|HelloWorldTutorial]] and application pages open in different tabs or browsers allows you to consult the documentation for the fix when you encounter the error.
