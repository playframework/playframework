# Play 2.9 Migration Guide

This guide is for migrating from Play 2.8 to Play 2.9. See the [[Play 2.8 Migration Guide|Migration28]] to upgrade from Play 2.7.

## How to migrate

Before starting `sbt`, make sure to make the following upgrades.

### Play update

Update the Play version number in `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.play" % "sbt-plugin" % "2.9.x")
```

Where the "x" in `2.9.x` is the minor version of Play you want to use, for instance `2.9.0`.

### sbt upgrade

Play 2.9 only supports sbt 1.8. To update, change your `project/build.properties` so that it reads:

```properties
sbt.version=1.9.2
```

At the time of this writing `1.9.2` is the latest version in the sbt 1.x family, you may be able to use newer versions too. Check the release notes for both Play's minor version [releases](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases) and sbt's [releases](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases) for details.

### Minimum required Java version

Play 2.9 requires at least [OpenJDK 8u252](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2020-April/011566.html) (the equivalent Oracle version is named [8u251](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u251-relnotes-5972664.html)) because it removed the [Jetty ALPN Agent](https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-alpn-agent), which, starting with those Java versions, is not strictly required anymore since the standard ALPN APIs have been [backported](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2019-November/010573.html) from Java 9.
In case you passed a `-javaagent:jetty-alpn-agent-*.jar` flag to your Play application(s) (maybe via `SBT_OPTS` environment variable) you have to remove that flags now.

## API Changes

Play 2.9 contains multiple API changes. As usual, we follow our policy of deprecating existing APIs before removing them. This section details these changes.

### Scala 2.12 support discontinued

Play 2.9 supports Scala 2.13, but not 2.12 anymore.

### Setting `scalaVersion` in your project

**Both Scala and Java users** must configure sbt to use Scala 2.13.  Even if you have no Scala code in your project, Play itself uses Scala and must be configured to use the right Scala libraries.

To set the Scala version in sbt, simply set the `scalaVersion` key, for example:

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.13.11"
```

If you have a single project build, then this setting can just be placed on its own line in `build.sbt`.  However, if you have a multi-project build, then the scala version setting must be set on each project.  Typically, in a multi-project build, you will have some common settings shared by every project, this is the best place to put the setting, for example:

```scala
def commonSettings = Seq(
  scalaVersion := "2.13.11"
)

val projectA = (project in file("projectA"))
  .enablePlugins(PlayJava)
  .settings(commonSettings)

val projectB = (project in file("projectB"))
  .enablePlugins(PlayJava)
  .settings(commonSettings)
```


### Renaming towards more consistent methods name

Some methods where renamed to enhance consistency accross different APIs, esspecialy methods for adding, removing and clearing data.
To enable a smooth migration, the older methods are now depreciated and will be removed in a future version.

Methods renamed in trait [`play.api.i18n.MessagesApi`](api/scala/play/api/i18n/MessagesApi.html) 

| **Deprecated method**                         | **New method**
| ----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| `clearLang(result: Result)`                   | `withoutLang(result: Result)`

Methods renamed in object [`play.api.mvc.Results`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/Results.html)

| **Deprecated method**                         | **New method**
| ----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| `clearingLang(result: Result)`                | `withoutLang(result: Result)`


### Deprecated APIs were removed

Many APIs that were deprecated in earlier versions were removed in Play 2.9. If you are still using them we recommend migrating to the new APIs before upgrading to Play 2.9. Check the Javadocs and Scaladocs for migration notes. See also the [[migration guide for Play 2.8|Migration28]] for more information.

### Changing CSP report types

There has been some changes in CSP reports, according to [w3.org specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/). Since Play 2.9 fields `lineNumber` and `columnNumber` are Longs. If your implementation bases on these fields being Strings, Play will fallback to parsing them from String to Long and throw an error only if parsing fails. It is however encouraged to use number types, not Strings, as this may be changed when CSP3 comes out.

## Configuration changes

This section lists changes and deprecations in configurations.

### Application Secret enforces a minimum length

The [[application secret|ApplicationSecret]] configuration `play.http.secret.key` is checked for a minimum length in all modes now (prod, dev and test). If that minimum length isn't met, then an error is thrown and the configuration is invalid, causing the application not to start.

The minimum length depends on the algorithm used to sign the session or flash cookie, which can be set via the config keys `play.http.session.jwt.signatureAlgorithm` and `play.http.flash.jwt.signatureAlgorithm`. By default the algorithm for both configs is `HS256` which requires the secret to contain at least 256 bits / 32 bytes. When choosing `HS384`, the minimums size is 384 bits / 48 bytes, for `HS512` it's 512 bits / 64 bytes.

The error that gets thrown contains all the information you need to resolve the problem:
```
Configuration error [
  The application secret is too short and does not have the recommended amount of entropy for algorithm HS256 defined at play.http.session.jwt.signatureAlgorithm.
  Current application secret bits: 248, minimal required bits for algorithm HS256: 256.
  To set the application secret, please read https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret
]
```

You can resolve such an error by setting the secret to contain the required amount of bits / bytes, like in this example at least 32 bytes of completely random input, such as `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64` or by the application secret generator, using `playGenerateSecret` or `playUpdateSecret`.

### New Logback configuration format

Starting with version 1.3, Logback uses a new canonical format for its configuration files. Since Play upgraded to the latest Logback version, you should transform your logback config files to the new format. That can be easily done with [this online translator](https://logback.qos.ch/translator/) provided by the Logback team. You need to log in via your GitHub account and then just copy/paste your existing Logback config to convert it.
The legacy config format will still work though, but we recommend to already upgrade now, since it's just copy and paste anyway.

In addition to that, we deprecated the Play specific `coloredLevel` converter. Logback [provides built-in patterns for coloring](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#coloring) since a long time already.
Therefore we recommend to remove following line from your logback config files:

```xml
<conversionRule conversionWord="coloredLevel" converterClass="play.api.libs.logback.ColoredLevel" />
```
and replace `%coloredLevel` with `%highlight(%-5level)` in your patterns:

```xml
<!-- deprecated: -->
<pattern>... %coloredLevel ...</pattern>

<!-- recommended: -->
<pattern>... %highlight(%-5level) ...</pattern>
```


### Removed `play.akka.config` setting

When bootstrapping an actor system Akka looks up its settings from within an (hardcoded) `akka` prefix within the "root" config it got passed. This actually has nothing to do with Play, this is just how Akka works.
By default, Play tells Akka to load its actor system settings directly from the application config root path, so you usually configure Play's actor system in `application.conf` inside `akka.*`.

Until Play 2.9 you could use the config `play.akka.config` to tell Play to load its Akka settings from another location, in case you wanted to use the `akka.*` settings for another Akka actor system. This config has now been removed for two reasons:

* That config was never well documented, e.g the docs did not mention that even if you set `play.akka.config = "my-akka"`, the `akka.*` settings from the config root path would still be loaded as fallback. That meant that if you changed something in the `akka.*` config, the actor system defined in `my-akka.akka.*` would also be affected. Therefore such two actor systems never existed independently from each other, so the promise `play.akka.config` made (allowing `akka.*` to be used solely for another Akka actor system) was not kept.

* Second, Play actually expects the actor system config to reside in `akka.*`, because it sets various configs within that prefix so everything works nicely. If you would use a complete different actor system for Play, your application would likely work not correctly anymore.

Because of these reasons, starting from Play 2.9 the `akka.*` prefix is dedicated only to Play's Akka config and can not be changed anymore. You can still use your own actor systems of course, just ensure you don't read their configuration from Play's `akka` prefix from the root path.

## Defaults changes

Some default values used by Play had changed and that can have an impact on your application. This section details the default changes.

### Caffeine has a new default value defined by `play.cache.caffeine.defaults.maximum-size`.

Application keeps on adding many items to the cache over time, then, with the Caffeine-based cache, the JVM will sooner or later crash because of `Out of Memory` error. We're defining a maximum size to `Caffeine` configuration to use 10000 as project default value.

## Dependency graph changes

If you start to use Scala 3 in your Play application, the Play `specs2` [[dependency|ScalaTestingWithSpecs2#Using-specs2]] will no longer pull in the [`"org.specs2" %% "specs2-mock"` dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.specs2/specs2-mock) because it is not available for Scala 3 anymore. 
The Play `specs2` Scala 3 artifacts depend on [`"org.mockito" % "mockito-core"`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core) instead to use [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) directly, which we think is the best alternative to switch your existing test code to at the time of this writing.
You need to adjust your code, e.g. here is a snippet of how to use Mockito:

```scala
import org.mockito.Mockito._
import org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers._

val userRepository = mock(classOf[UserRepository])
when(userRepository.roles(any[User])).thenReturn(Set(Role("ADMIN")))
```

## Updated libraries

Besides updates to newer versions of our own libraries (play-json, play-ws, twirl, cachecontrol, etc), many other important dependencies were updated to the newest versions:

* Guice 5.0.0
