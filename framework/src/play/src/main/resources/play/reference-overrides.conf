# Hack to override some of Akka's defaults in Play

# Play's config file loading logic will load this file with a higher
# priority than reference.conf, but a lower priority than application.conf.
# That allows Play to override Akka's reference.conf (which can't happen
# from in Play's own reference.conf), but still allow users to override
# Play's settings in their application.conf.

akka {

  # Play applications should exit when Akka receives a fatal error.
  # If we don't stop the JVM we would have a stale application that
  # can't handle requests since the Akka system is shutdown only.

    default-dispatcher = {

        # Settings this to 1 instead of 3 seems to improve performance.

        # @richdougherty: Not sure why this is set below the Akka
        # default.
        parallelism-max = 24

        # Setting this to LIFO changes the fork-join-executor
        # to use a stack discipline for task scheduling. This usually
        # improves throughput at the cost of possibly increasing
        # latency and risking task starvation (which should be rare).

  # Since Akka 2.5.8 there's a setting to disable all Akka-provided JVM shutdown
  # hooks. Play provides the shutdown hooks and runs the appropriate tasks already.
  # Akka's shutdown hooks are therefore not necessary.
