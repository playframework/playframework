      # Enables/disables automatic handling of HEAD requests.
      # If this setting is enabled the server dispatches HEAD requests as GET
      # requests to the application and automatically strips off all message
      # bodies from outgoing responses.
      # Note that, even when this setting is off the server will never send
      # out message bodies on responses to HEAD requests.
      # For Play to work correctly with WebSockets, you should avoid setting this config to "on",
      # see https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/7060

      # header to make the server accept such requests.
      # Note that the server will never accept HTTP/1.1 request without a `Host`
      # header, i.e. this setting only affects HTTP/1.1 requests with an empty
      # `Host` header as well as HTTP/1.0 requests.

      # the application) on one single connection before the first request
      # has to be completed.
      # Incoming requests that would cause the pipelining limit to be exceeded
      # are not read from the connections socket so as to build up "back-pressure"
      # to the client via TCP flow control.
      # A setting of 1 disables HTTP pipelining, since only one request per
      # connection can be "open" (i.e. being processed by the application) at any time.
      # This value must be > 0 and <= 1024.
      # ATTENTION:
      # Only enable HTTP pipelining if you _really_ know what you are doing. Nowadays, HTTP pipelining
      # is mostly used for benchmarks anyway. Basically all web browser and most common clients (like curl)
      # removed support for HTTP pipelining, since most client and server implementations were error prone.
      # Also the implemention used by Play can cause unexpected behaviour, e.g. see
      # https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/12351
