/**
 * The ForwardedHeaderHandler class works out the remote address and protocol
 * by taking
 * into account Forward and X-Forwarded-* headers from trusted proxies. The
 * algorithm it uses is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Start with the immediate connection to the application.
 * 2. If the proxy *did not* send a valid Forward or X-Forward-* header then return
 *    that connection and don't do any further processing.
 * 3. If the proxy *did* send a valid header then work out whether we trust it by
 *    checking whether the immediate connection is in our list of trusted
 *    proxies.
 * 4. If the immediate connection *is* a trusted proxy, then resume at step
 *    1 using the connection info in the forwarded header.
 * 5. If the immediate connection *is not* a trusted proxy, then return the
 *    immediate connection info and don't do any further processing.
 *
 * Each address is associated with a secure or insecure protocol by pairing
 * it with a `proto` entry in the headers. If the `proto` entry is missing or
 * if `proto` entries can't be matched with addresses, then the default is
 * insecure.
 *
 * It is configured by two configuration options:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>play.http.forwarded.version</dt>
 *   <dd>
 *     The version of the forwarded headers ist uses to parse the headers. It can be
 *     <code>x-forwarded</code> for legacy headers or
 *     <code>rfc7239</code> for the definition from the RFC 7239 <br>
 *     Default is x-forwarded.
 *   </dd>
 *   <dt>play.http.forwarded.trustedProxies</dt>
 *   <dd>
 *     A list of proxies that are ignored when getting the remote address or the remote port.
 *     It can have optionally an address block size. When the address block size is set,
 *     all IP-addresses in the range of the subnet will be treated as trusted.
 *   </dd>
 * </dl>
