    # Forwarded header configuration
    # Play supports various forwarded headers used by proxies to indicate the incoming IP address and protocol of
    # requests. Play uses this in the implementation of the RequestHeader.remoteAddress and RequestHeader.secure
    # fields.
    forwarded = {

      # The version of forwarded headers to use.
      # Valid values are x-forwarded and rfc7239.
      # x-forwarded uses the de facto standard X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers to determine the correct
      # remote address and protocol for the request. These headers are widely used, however, they have some serious
      # limitations, for example, if you have multiple proxies, and only one of them adds the X-Forwarded-Proto header,
      # it's impossible to reliably determine which proxy added it and therefore whether the request from the client
      # was made using https or http. rfc7239 uses the new Forwarded header standard, and solves many of the
      # limitations of the X-Forwarded-* headers.
      version = "x-forwarded"

      # The trusted proxies.
      # Trusted proxies may either be individual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or be IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address ranges.
      # This is used to prevent IP address spoofing. Multiple proxies can add and append to the forwarded headers,
      # including the client, which could masquerade as a proxy proxying requests on behalf of another client.  Play
      # will validate that the incoming request IP, and all forwarded headers match the addresses in this list, and will
      # present the first untrusted IP address that it finds (or if all addresses are trusted, the last address) to the
      # application.
      # Note that a number of cloud hosting platforms, most notably AWS, make no guarantees as to what IP addresses
      # their proxies will make requests from. If this is the case, in order for Play to respect the forwarded headers,
      # you need to trust all IP addresses, therefore making it possible for clients to spoof the incoming address.
      # To trust all IP addresses, set this to ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"].
      trustedProxies = ["127.0.0.1", "::1"]
