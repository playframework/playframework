/**
 * This trait is used to provide non-blocking timeouts and delays on an operation that returns a Future.
 *
 * You can dependency inject the Futures as follows to create a Future that will
 * timeout after a certain period of time:
 *
 * {{{
 * class MyService @Inject()(futures: Futures, piCalculator: PiCalculator) extends Timeout {
 *   def calculateWithTimeout(timeoutDuration: FiniteDuration): Future[Int] = {
 *     futures.timeout(timeoutDuration)(piCalculator.rawCalculation())
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * And you can also use a delay to return data after a given period of time.
 *
 * {{{
 * class PiCalculator @Inject()(futures: Futures) {
 *   def rawCalculation(): Future[Int] = {
 *     futures.delay(300 millis) { Future.successful(42) }
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * You should check for timeout by using `scala.concurrent.Future.recover` or `scala.concurrent.Future.recoverWith`
 * and checking for [[scala.concurrent.TimeoutException]]:
 *
 * {{{
 * val future = myService.calculateWithTimeout(100 millis).recover {
 *   case _: TimeoutException =>
 *     -1
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * @see [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html Futures and Promises]]
